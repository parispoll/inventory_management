# Inventory Management System (Python)

## Overview
A Python-based inventory management tool developed to track stock levels on a daily basis in a real working environment (5-star hotel storage). The system helps ensure timely reordering and reduces shortages by maintaining accurate inventory records.

## Features
- Daily inventory updates
- Stock level tracking
- Simple and efficient data handling
- Designed for real-world operational use

## Technologies Used
- Python
- File I/O
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)

## Motivation
This project was created to solve a real operational problem while working as a storage assistant. Manual inventory tracking was inefficient, so this tool automated updates and supported better ordering decisions.

## Future Improvements
- Database integration
- Reporting and analytics
- GUI or web-based interface
